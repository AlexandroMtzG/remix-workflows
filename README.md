### Remix Workflows

This is the Workflows feature of [SaasRock](https://saasrock.com), read the introduction article [here](https://saasrock.com/docs/articles/workflows).

### Demo

- Try it out (read-only): [https://remix-workflows.vercel.app](https://remix-workflows.vercel.app)
- [Watch the introduction video demo](https://www.loom.com/share/c5d6a04da4214e3689b38d0e5d211e25)

### Getting Started

ðŸ’¿ Rename .env.example to .env and set your variables.

ðŸ’¿ Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

ðŸ’¿ Initialize the database _(the `schema.prisma` db provider must match the `DATABASE_URL` provider)_:

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This should apply the migrations and seed the database with sample workflows.

Or you could manually push the schema, and seed the database manually:

```
npx prisma db push
npx prisma db seed
```

ðŸ’¿ Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

ðŸ’¿ Build workflows ðŸŽ‰!
